# FACT extractor

Wraps FACT unpack plugins into standalone utility.
Should be able to extract most of the common container formats.


## Command line usage

Quickest usage if you have docker running:

```sh
docker pull fkiecad/fact_extractor
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fkie-cad/fact_extractor/master/extract.py
chmod +x extract.py
./extract.py ./relative/or/absolute/path/to/your/file
```

for more options see

```sh
./extract.py --help
```

## Local setup (aka not running through docker)

Install with:

```bash
fact_extractor/install/pre_install.sh
fact_extractor/install.py
```

:warning: **We no longer support Ubuntu 18.04 and Python <3.8** 
(It may still work with a bit of tinkering, though)

:warning: For the `generic_fs` unpacker plugin to work with all file system types, you may need to install extra kernel modules

```sh
sudo apt install linux-modules-extra-$(uname -r)
```

The tool can then be run with

```bash
fact_extractor/fact_extract.py [OPTIONS] PATH_TO_FIRMWARE
```
The tool is build with docker in mind.
To that end it extracts all files into a directory specified in the config.
The same directory also contains the meta data report.
Directories are created during installation, if config is changed make sure to recreate the folder structure.
It looks like:

```text
<path_to_data_folder>
├── files
└── reports
```


## Use docker container directly

Build with

```bash
docker build -t fact_extractor .
```
(Replace `fact_extractor` with own id if you like)

The docker execution was build so that a single shared directory can be used for container input and output.
Prepare a folder on the host system that resembles

```text
<path_to_shared_folder>
├── files
├── input
│   └── firmware_file
└── reports
```

where **firmware_file** is the file you want to unpack.
Run the extraction with

```bash
docker run -v <path_to_shared_folder>:/tmp/extractor -v /dev:/dev --privileged --rm fact_extractor
```
(see above)

:warning: Note that the container is run in privileged mode and shares the /dev folder. Thus the container can possibly harm your system in every way.
